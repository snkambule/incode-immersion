/* Write a function `displayName` that takes two arguments, a name and a surname, and displays them James Bond-style. 

Look at the test cases to understand, your function must work the same way!


Here are a few test cases:

Test:   displayName("James", "Bond")
Output: 
```My name is Bond, James Bond
```

Test:   displayName("Ada", "Lovelace")
```My name is Lovelace, Ada Lovelace
```


Hint: When we say *display*, you need to use `console.log`.*/

function displayName(name,surname){
    console.log("My name is "+surname+", "+name+" "+surname);
}

displayName("Sibusiso","Nkambule");
